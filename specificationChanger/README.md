# Graph
- Contains data structures representing the **specification graph** (consisting of an application graph and an architecture graph) and its elements

#### Offers the possibility to:
- **Load** the elements from a specification given in ./.\./instances_spec
- **Modify** the specification graph by either exchanging, adding or deleting a percentage of tasks (in the application graph) and of processors (in the architecture graph). The kind of change can be set manually or randomly. It is randomly (with a random seed) decided which elements are changed.
- **Save** a modified version of the specification in ./.\./instances_spec
