Processor p1 can not be removed, because one mapped task would otherwise be without any mapping option.
DELETE to p27 (61.5385 % of 61.5385 % in total) 
Processor p27 can not be removed, because one mapped task would otherwise be without any mapping option.
Only 87.5% of the deletion of processors could be done.
It could only be done up to 95.4545% of the changes on the specification, that means up to 77.7778% changes on the processor elements in total.
