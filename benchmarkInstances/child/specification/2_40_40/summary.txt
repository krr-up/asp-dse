DELETE to p1 (28.5714 % of 28.5714 % in total) 
Processor p1 can not be removed, because one mapped task would otherwise be without any mapping option.
Only 50% of the deletion of processors could be done.
It could only be done up to 75% of the changes on the specification, that means up to 33.3333% changes on the processor elements in total.
