DELETE to p2 (57.1429 % of 57.1429 % in total) 
Processor p2 can not be removed, because one mapped task would otherwise be without any mapping option.
DELETE to p8 (57.1429 % of 57.1429 % in total) 
Processor p8 can not be removed, because one mapped task would otherwise be without any mapping option.
Only 75% of the deletion of processors could be done.
It could only be done up to 83.3333% of the changes on the specification, that means up to 55.5556% changes on the processor elements in total.
