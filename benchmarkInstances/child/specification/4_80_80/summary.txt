Processor p6 can not be removed, because one mapped task would otherwise be without any mapping option.
DELETE to p7 (50 % of 83.3333 % in total) 
Processor p7 can not be removed, because one mapped task would otherwise be without any mapping option.
DELETE to p2 (50 % of 83.3333 % in total) 
DELETE to p9 (66.6667 % of 83.3333 % in total) 
Processor p9 can not be removed, because one mapped task would otherwise be without any mapping option.
Only 60% of the deletion of processors could be done.
It could only be done up to 75% of the changes on the specification, that means up to 66.6667% changes on the processor elements in total.
