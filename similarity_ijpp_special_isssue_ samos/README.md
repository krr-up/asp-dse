- The content of this folder is based `../heuristic`

- The aim of the adaptions is to reduce the Grounding size by using the `equal(_,_)` and `unequal(_,_)` rules separately

- Therefore, `compareImplementationEqual.lp` can be used with `heuristic1.lp, preferenceReward1.lp, strategy4.lp`

- And `compareImplementationUnequal.lp` can be used with  `heuristic2.lp, preferencePunish1.lp, strategy3.lp`

- `constants.lp` is still needed for all cases

- `compareSpecification.lp`, `hamming.lp` is not used anymore
