# asp-dse - ASP-based solution for design space exploration in the context of evolutionary product design

- Improving the design space exploration of a child configuration derived from a parent configuration by using the knowledge about similarities and differences of their specifications and implementations
- Utilization of strategies and heuristics


## Note that two versions of similarity evaluation and usage are differentiated
- Readers of "Investigating Methods for ASPmT-based Design Space Exploration in Evolutionary Product Design" (from IJPP Special Issue Samos) are referred to **similarity_ijpp_special_issue_ samos**
- Readers of "Evolutionary System Design with Answer Set Programming" (from MDPI Journal Algorithms) are referred to **similarity_alg**
